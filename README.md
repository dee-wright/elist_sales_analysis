# E-List E-Commerce Sales Analysis (2019-2022)
Founded in 2018, E-List is an e-commerce company that sells popular electronics products and has since expanded to a global customer base. Like most e-commerce companies, E-List sells products through their online site as well as through their mobile app. They use a variety of marketing channels to reach customers, including email campaigns, SEO, and affiliate links. Over the last few years, their more popular products have been products from Apple, Samsung, and Lenovo.

## Dashboard
I created a dashboard within Excel to gather sales, product, and marketing data in one place. This dashboard can be filtered by year, region, and product, in order to provide more granular insight as needed.

## Overview
The ERD for this data is located [here](./assets/EList_ERD.png)

Between 2019 and 2022, 108,094 orders were placed, netting $28 million in sales. Sales peaked in 2020, with $10.1 million across 33,000 sales and have been dropping since; however, this drop brings 2022 more in line with sales in 2019 ($3.8m), possibly signaling a normalization of sales post-pandemic. Further insight will be gleaned by including pre-2019 data and 2023 data for a more complete picture. 

I analyzed sales, order count, average order value, refund rate, loyalty program performance, and product performance to provide insights and recommendations to cross-functional departments (marketing, sales, inventory management). 

## Summary of Insights
### Overall Sales Analysis

While E-List experienced sales growth of 162% and order quantity growth of 101% from 2019 to 2020, the following year saw a sales dollar drop of 10% (even though order quantities rose by 6%), and 2021 to 2022 had a precipitous drop of -46% in sales and -40% in order totals.

Growth analysis at the more granular monthly level shows consistent seasonal trends - Elist always experiences a major drop in February and another in October. These months bookend the holiday shopping period of November-December.

Average order value has returned to its pre-pandemic level of $230 overall. 2020 saw a jump of 31% ($300) while 2021 fell 15% ($255). This also lends credence to the hypothesis that our sales are returning to pre-pandemic levels.

### Refund Rates
Consistently, our most-refunded products are laptops (both Apple and Samsung).

### Product Analysis
Our bestselling product year over year in terms of revenue is the 27 inch 4K gaming monitor, followed closely by Apple AirPods. In terms of number of orders, Apple AirPods are our most-purchased product. On the other end of the scale, we've only sold 27 pairs of Bose headphones in 3 years. Product sales patterns remain similar across 2019, 2021, and 2022; the one exception to this is MacBooks, which saw a sales spike during the pandemic.

### Loyalty Program Performance
Examination of the loyalty program year over year shows that while it got off to a shaky start, 55% of orders that were placed in 2022 came in under the loyalty program, with program participation showing positive growth in 2020, 2021, and 2022.

## Recommendations
### Seasonality
As we experience sales drops on each side of the holiday shopping season, we should look at what promotions we can offer during those times in order to boost sales. 

### Product Inventory
I do not recommend restocking the Bose headphones. Depending on profit margin and cost to hold in inventory, I recommend looking at including these as a bonus for ordering under the loyalty program or as a bonus with other orders, in order to make room for better-selling products on our shelves. 

### Marketing 
Webcams have the highest percentage of the email marketing channel (70% of all webcam sales) and the loyalty program (86% of all webcam sales), but are low-price items. I recommend looking into ways to fine-tune our email advertising to boost sales of larger items like monitors and laptops - for example, these types of products often have a more involved consumer decision journey, and we could devote a full email ad to the features that consumers research most with these products.

### Loyalty Program
Based on the growth of the program thus far, I recommend that we keep the program and focus our efforts on products that have the lowest participation in the program (which are also our largest ticket items: laptops & monitors).
